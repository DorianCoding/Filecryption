# Filecryption
Allows encryption and decryption of files using Argon2i and XChaCha20Poly1305 in Rust.
## Usage
* Clone the repo, and download the binary for your architecture or run `binary.sh` or `cargo run`. **Rust needs to be installed** (version >= 1.73). If you have a older version, you can try to run it using `cargo run --ignore-rust-version` but it is not guaranteed to work.
* The script works only from the command line.
* Enjoy :+1:
```
Allows encryption and decryption of files using Argon2 and XChaCha20Poly1305

Usage: filecryption [OPTIONS] <ACTION> [FILE]...

Arguments:
  <ACTION>   [possible values: encrypt, decrypt, compute]
  [FILE]...  File(s)/Directories to encrypt/decrypt

Options:
  -a, --argon2 <ARGON2>      Argon parameter (default should be fit, but can be computed with -t), set exponential for argon, must be between 5 (very low - low CPU devices) and 50 (nearly impossible to compute) [default: 16]
  -f, --filename             Encrypt filename
  -p, --password <PASSWORD>  Password input
  -r, --recursive            Recursive all directories and files
  -v, --verbose              verbose mode
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version

```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not try to reencrypt already encrypted files.
> It is clear that this program performs a real encryption and if you alter, edit encrypted files, the parameters file created or lose your password, it ***will be impossible to decrypt your data***. You should keep a backup on a secure device.
> Do not attempt to change extension, filenames of files, move or delete the parameters file created. However, you can tag it as immuable : `# chattr +i file` (as a root) 


Example :
* `./script encrypt file.txt` to encrypt file.txt
* `./script decrypt file.txt` to decrypt file.txt
* `./script -f decrypt file.txt` to decrypt file.txt and its filename
* `./script -frv encrypt ~` to encrypt and verbose full home and its filename
* `./script -frv encrypt ~` to decrypt and verbose full home and its filename

## Informations

Files inside directories won't be taken into account unless recursive is set. 
Password would be asked in secure tty but can be unsecurely provide as an argument.
A hidden file is created containing the salt and derivation parameters for Argon2.
It should be automatically detected when encrypting and decrypting. **This file is needed to decrypt and should not be moved or altered**.

## Argon2i infos

Depending on your platform and devices, [argon parameters](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html#name-argon2-inputs-and-outputs) can be edited. To detect the trade-off configuration, run `./script compute`
and provide this value as `-a value` when using this script. The default value is 16 and is [the recommended value](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html#name-parameter-choice).

*Keep in mind that values higher than 20 could just make your computer lag or crashes
and you **should really** compute before choosing a higher value than default.*
